This is a simple prototype of a movie aggregation site/platform which uses javascript to render a group of movies as well as allowing users to use the admin page.

To use the admin page, you fill in your movie title, movie description/bio, and add a image url for the movie's image (these have been borrowed from imdb in the case of this demo).

the layout is based on CSS flexbox and media queries are used for additional responsiveness
